# 🔢 Digit Reconstruction with Autoencoders and PCA (MNIST)

📚 University project for the course **Neural Networks – Deep Learning**.  

This project focuses on the **reconstruction of digits from the MNIST dataset** using three different approaches:  
1. A **classic autoencoder**  
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
3. An **autoencoder designed to predict the next digit**  

---

## ✨ Project Overview
The implementation consists of four Python scripts:

- **`Classic_Autoencoder.py`**  
  Trains a classic autoencoder to reconstruct the original images.  

- **`PCA_Reconstruction.py`**  
  Implements reconstruction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  

- **`Next_Digit_Autoencoder.py`**  
  Uses an autoencoder to predict the next digit.  

- **`Classifier.py`**  
  Contains a neural network classifier to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstructed digits.  

---

## ⚙️ Usage Notes
- **`Classifier.py` must be executed first** in order to:  
  - Train the classifier  
  - Save the trained model  
- After that, the other scripts can be executed independently.  
- Each script includes its own implementation, from **data loading and preprocessing** to **performance evaluation**.

## 📊 Results and Report
The project includes a **detailed results report**, which provides:  
- Performance summary for each reconstruction method  
- Examples of correct and incorrect reconstructions  
- Comparative analysis of the three approaches  
- Insights into the effectiveness of each method and their potential applications  

---

## 🧪 Purpose
The project is organized to:  
- Facilitate **comparison of reconstruction approaches**  
- Support **technical evaluation**  
- Provide **comprehensive documentation of results**
